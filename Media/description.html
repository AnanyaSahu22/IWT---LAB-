<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This project demonstrates the use of HTML to create a simple media page
with separate sections for an image, a tutorial link, and a description.
The main page contains clickable links that navigate to each section, showing
how HTML links can organize and present content clearly.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial link leads to a GitHub tutorial. GitHub is a web-based platform
used for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to
store code, track changes, and work together on projects efficiently.
